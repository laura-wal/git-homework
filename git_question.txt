1. How do you create a new git repository locally?
- Create a file then type - git init

2. How would you find out what files are currently staged?
- type in git status (I would just use the up arrow key)

3. How would you add a file to the staging area?
- I would type git add . (this wouyld add all files in the folder to the staging area)

4.How would you commit your changes with the message
-  Type in: git commit -m "what I did" (press enter) then check it by checking the status

Adding git-test questions ?
